# Spotify Recommendation System

This project implements a recommendation system for Spotify songs based on user preferences and audio features. It utilizes machine learning techniques to calculate song similarity using cosine similarity and provides song recommendations based on a user-selected song. The dataset includes audio features like danceability, energy, tempo, and more, allowing the system to make meaningful recommendations.

## Installation

To get started, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/spotify-recommendation-system.git
cd spotify-recommendation-system
```

### Install Dependencies

Ensure that you have Python 3.x installed. Then, install the necessary dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The `requirements.txt` file includes the following packages:
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- numpy
- matplotlib (optional for visualizations)

## Dataset

The project uses a dataset containing Spotify songs with their respective audio features. These features include:

- Acousticness
- Danceability
- Energy
- Instrumentalness
- Liveness
- Loudness
- Speechiness
- Tempo
- Valence

You can download the dataset from the provided link or upload your own dataset in the required format (CSV) with the same structure.

## Usage

1. **Load the dataset**: The script loads the dataset and inspects its structure.

2. **Preprocess the data**: The dataset is cleaned and preprocessed by converting the `liked` column to categorical labels and handling any missing values.

3. **Feature scaling**: The features are scaled using `MinMaxScaler` to ensure they contribute equally to the similarity score.

4. **Similarity calculation**: Cosine similarity is used to calculate the similarity between songs based on their audio features.

5. **Generate recommendations**: The system can recommend the top N most similar songs to a given song.

Example of usage in Python:

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity

# Load data
data = pd.read_csv('spotify_recommendation_system.csv')

# Preprocess data
data['liked'] = data['liked'].apply(lambda x: 'liked' if x == 1 else 'dislike')
data = data.dropna()

# Feature scaling
features = ['acousticness', 'danceability', 'energy', 'instrumentalness', 'liveness', 'loudness', 'speechiness', 'tempo', 'valence']
scaler = MinMaxScaler()
data[features] = scaler.fit_transform(data[features])

# Cosine similarity calculation
similarity_matrix = cosine_similarity(data[features])

# Recommendation function
def recommend_songs(song_index, num_recommendations=5):
    similarity_scores = list(enumerate(similarity_matrix[song_index]))
    sorted_songs = sorted(similarity_scores, key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)[1:num_recommendations+1]
    recommended_songs = [data.iloc[i[0]]['title'] for i in sorted_songs]
    return recommended_songs

# Example: Recommend 5 songs similar to the song at index 0
print(recommend_songs(0, 5))
```

## Features

- **Cosine Similarity**: Calculates similarity between songs based on audio features.
- **Song Recommendation**: Suggests the top N most similar songs to a given song.
- **User Preference**: Prioritizes recommendations based on user preferences (liked/disliked songs).
- **Scalable**: The system can handle a large number of songs and easily scale with additional features or data.

## Technologies

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- numpy
